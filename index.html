        People call me the Anime Prof! This world is inhabited by creatures called Weebs! 
        For some people, weebs are pets. Others use them for fights. Myself...I study weebs as a profession. Are you a boy or a girl?! 
        Ummmm... I guess I cant ask those types of questions any more! Atleast, I can ask this question!
        what is you name? what! you have already put your name! Well aren't you a quick one. You know what, just keep going!
        Seems like you didn't need me in the first place.</p>
